    "# A user's guide to the *idealista* public search API.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains how to obtain property information published in the *idealista* website using the most exciting programing language out there: the one and only [Julia](https://julialang.org) language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, a little background on *idealista* is due. This Spanish enterprise was funded in 2000 and offers real estate services across the entire Spanish geography since 2004. Moreover, they have recently expanded to Italy and Portugal. For more information on their history, you can check their Wikipedia page [here](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealista.com). \n",
    "\n",
    "The *idealista* web portal is the most widely used in Spain, and as a result, it has information on a wide range of listed properties across the Spanish geography. This information includes characteristics of the dwellings, e.g. size, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, etc., as well as their asking prices. Consequently, obtaining this information can be very helpful for those interested in housing and rental markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, the *idealista* lab offers the possibility to access their database through a public API. In particular, anyone interested can request access in [here](https://developers.idealista.com/access-request). As a result, and after some weeks of waiting, you will receive an \"apikey\" and a \"secret\". These two will allow you to obtain a token that is valid for a maximum of 100 requests per month. I'll show below how to obtain that token using Julia. Given the OAuth 2.0 Authentication bearer token, you will be able to send a request to their public API using different filters on your search. For example, you can decide on the type of operation (sale vs rent), type of property (homes, offices, premises, garages, bedrooms) and/or the location (e.g. Madrid). Once you have selected and specified a value for your filters, you are ready to send the HTTP request and obtain a list with the current listed properties that satisfy your search parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important limitation.** So far it seems that the *idealista* can be a great source of information for the housing and rental markets in Spain. However, not all that glitters is gold. The public API  only allows you to recover 50 listings at a time. This is because the number of items per page is limited to 50 and you have to specify the page number in your search. Consequently, the combination of this maximum number of item limit and the 100 requests per month limit make the public API insufficient for large scale research projects unless you are willing to spend some money! \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that it is possible to go beyond the 100 requests per month but you will have to dig deep into your pockets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bearing that in mind, let's get started!"
